v0.1.0 (expected January 14, 2019)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New classes
###########

 * WindFarm class for modelling a wind farm. Defines a standard set of wind farm attributes, for example aggregated power curve and wind farm efficiency to take wake losses into account.
 * WindTurbineCluster class for modelling a turbine cluster that contains several wind turbines and/or wind farms. This class is useful for gathering all wind turbines in a weather data grid cell. An aggregated power curve can be calculated which considers the wake losses of the wind farms by a set efficiency if desired.
 * TurbineClusterModelChain class shows the usage of new functions and classes of windpowerlib v.0.1 and is based on the ModelChain class.

New functions
#############

 * power curve smoothing for taking into account the spatial distribution of wind speed
 * application of wake losses to a power curve
 * application of wake losses to a wind speed time series
 * logarithmic interpolation/extrapolation for wind speed time series
 * gauss distribution
 * estimation of turbulence intensity by roughness length


Testing
#######

 * added continuous integration to automatically test the windpowerlib for different python versions and to check the test coverage


Documentation
#############

 * added second example section and jupyter notebook


Other changes
#############
 * removed deprecated attributes (.ix)
 * renamed examples according to modelchains
