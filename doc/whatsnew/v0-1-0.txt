v0.1.0 (January 16, 2019)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New classes
###########

 * WindFarm class for modelling a wind farm. Defines a standard set of wind farm attributes, for example aggregated power curve and wind farm efficiency to take wake losses into account.
 * WindTurbineCluster class for modelling a turbine cluster that contains several wind turbines and/or wind farms. This class is useful for gathering all wind turbines in a weather data grid cell. An aggregated power curve can be calculated which considers the wake losses of the wind farms by a set efficiency if desired.
 * TurbineClusterModelChain class shows the usage of new functions and classes of windpowerlib v.0.1 and is based on the ModelChain class.

New functions
#############

 * power curve smoothing for taking into account the spatial distribution of wind speed
 * application of wake losses to a power curve
 * application of wake losses to a wind speed time series by using wind efficiency curves which are provided in the data directory
 * logarithmic interpolation/extrapolation for wind speed time series
 * gauss distribution
 * estimation of turbulence intensity by roughness length
 * retrieve power curves from Open Energy Database


Testing
#######

 * added continuous integration to automatically test the windpowerlib for different python versions and to check the test coverage


Documentation
#############

 * added second example section and jupyter notebook
 * added model description


API changes
###########

 * renamed attribute 'turbine_name' of WindTurbine object to 'name' to match with 'name' attribute of WindFarm and WindTurbineCluster
 * renamed `basic_example` to `modelchain_example`
 * renamed column 'values' of power curves to 'power' and column 'values' of power coefficient curves to 'power coefficient'
 * renamed `run_basic_example()` to `run_example()`
 * renamed parameter `wind_turbine` of `ModelChain` object to `power_plant`
 * removed parameter `density_correction` from `power_plant.power_coefficient()`


Other changes
#############
 * removed deprecated attributes (.ix)
 * added `turbine_cluster_modelchain_example` showing the usage of the TurbineClusterModelChain
